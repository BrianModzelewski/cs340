How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I build programs with these attributes in mind by evaluating every use case or aim I have for a software. If I know I'll be using a software for something else in the future, I'll make it as simple to grasp and adaptive as possible. The benefits of this for the Python CRUD module were that it was easily expandable for subsequent modules that we utilized it in. I could use this module in the future to connect to any other MongoDB instance I may end up using.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I tackle challenges in a rigorous and analytical manner. I did my best to grasp Grazioso Salvare's needs and figure out precisely what he was looking for, as well as what I would need to do to execute those modifications. This is different from prior classes since I am not normally this detailed or exact. In the future, I would most likely employ these ways of producing and collecting data from databases to add value to my client's product.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


Computer scientists create and develop computer-based solutions to optimize or simplify processes in order to increase work efficiency. This is significant because computer scientists' work drives productivity and allows us to analyze data in ways never before imaginable by using the power of computers. My work on these sorts of projects would assist businesses in doing their jobs more effectively by giving them with additional information about their business processes or optimizing their company workflows to optimize efficiency and, hence, revenues.
